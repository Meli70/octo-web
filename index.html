<p class="hello"><em>Hello world</em>! My name is <strong>Cynthia Meli</strong> and I would like to share with you a little bit about myself.</p>
  </div>

<h1 id="About">About Me</h1>
<h1>Birth and Early Childhood</h1>
<p class="child">I was born on <span class="birthday">September 20, 2000</span> in the beautiful city of Nairobi. Life was simple as a child because my
  parents struggled to ensure I was in school, ate and had a roof over me.
  However, they seperated when I was four years old and since then, life has never been the same. I have travelled
  to a number of places with my mum and younger sister as she, my mum, struggled to make ends meet as she was now on her
  own. To be honest, my role model is my mum because she has taught me how to survive no matter the weather. She has
  taught me to believe in God and that with Him, everything is possible.

  <ul>
    <li>2019-present: Software development- Moringa School</li>
    <li>2015-2018: High School Certificate- New light Senior Girls Kitengela. Grade (B-)</li>
    <li>2007-2014: Primary School Certificate- Green Garden School, Kikuyu. Marks attained (397)</li>
    <li>2006-2003: Nursery School.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am currently in Moringa school undertaking Software development prep. I chose to do the program because it will
    help me understand cerain concepts in a detailed and more organised manner. Thus, it will give me an upper hand as I
    pursue my studies in university from next year, 2020.</p>

  <p>During my stay in Moringa,I have created a number of projects that have enabled me to practice what I have learnt so far. For example:</p>

  <ol>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/Meli70/blue-red.git">blue red</a></li>
    This page was created in order to practice branching with git and github.
    Languages used include:
  <ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
  </ul>
    <li> <a href="https://github.com/Meli70/vigilant-website.git">vigilant</a></li>
    This is the <span class="first">first</span> webpage I created. It includes all that I will be learning during my stay at Moringa.
    Languages used include:
  <ul>

  <h1 id="Skills">Hobbies/Skills/Interests</h1>
  <p>I have always been interested in the world of art since I was a child. As a result, I have attended and participated
    in a number of music festivals throughout my Highschool life as well as writing a number of poetic pieces. I have not
    yet put them out in the open but I intend to in the near future.</p>
  <p>I am a self-taught make up artist.</p>
  <p>The agriculture sector is of great interest to me. I believe that with a positive attitude, commitment, current
    trends & skill, space, labour and capital, one could make it in agriculture.</p>
  <p>I travel once in a while as a hobby. I have been to a number of places in Kenya, including remote areas such as
    Marsabit. I have been to coast several times and once lived in Amman, Jordan for three years. It is a beautiful
    country with many historical sites and I would encourage people to visit the country if given the chance.</p>
