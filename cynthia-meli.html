    <p>Hello world! My name is Cynthia Meli and I would like to share with you a little bit about myself.</p>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h1>Birth and Early Childhood</h1>
    <p>I was born on September 20, 2000 in the beautiful city of Nairobi. Life was simple as a child because my parents struggled to ensure I was in school, ate and had a roof over me.
      However, my parents seperated when I was four years old and since then, life has never been the same. I have travelled to a number of places with my mum and younger sister as she, my mum, struggled to make ends meet as she was now on her own. To be honest, my role model is my mum because she has taught me how to survive no matter the weather. She has taught me to believe in God and that with Him, everything is possible. 
    </p>

    <h1>Education</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>2019-present: Software development- Moringa School</li>
      <li>2015-2018: High School Certificate- New light Senior Girls Kitengela. Grade (B-)</li>
      <li>2007-2014: Primary School Certificate- Green Garden School, Kikuyu. Marks attained (397)</li>
      <li>2006-2003: Nursery School.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I am currently in Moringa school undertaking Software development prep. I chose to do the program because it will help me understand cerain concepts in a detailed and more organised manner. Thus, it will give me an upper hand as I pursue my studies in university from next year, 2020.</p>

    <h1>Hobbies/Skills/Interests</h1>
    <p>I have always been interested in the world of art since I was a child. As a result, I have attended and participated in a number of music festivals throughout my Highschool life as well as writing a number of poetic pieces. I have not yet put them out in the open but I intend to in the near future.</p>
    <p>I am a self-taught make up artist.</p>
    <p>The agriculture sector is of great interest to me. I believe that with a positive attitude, commitment, current trends & skill, space, labour and capital, one could make it in agriculture.</p>
