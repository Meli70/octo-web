    <p>Hello world! My name is Cynthia Meli and I would like to share with you a little bit about myself.</p>
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h1>Birth and Early Childhood</h1>
    <p>I was born on September 20, 2000 in the beautiful city of Nairobi. Life was simple as a child because my parents struggled to ensure I was in school, ate and had a roof over me.
      However, my parents seperated when I was four years old and since then, life has never been the same. I have travelled to a number of places with my mum and younger sister as she, my mum, struggled to make ends meet as she was now on her own. To be honest, my role model is my mum because she has taught me how to survive no matter the weather. She has taught me to believe in God and that with Him, everything is possible.
